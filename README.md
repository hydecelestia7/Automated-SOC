# Automated Security Operations Center (SOC)

# Overview

The primary objective of this lab is to create an automated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment that closely mirrors real-world incident detection, analysis, and response scenarios. Using open-source software, this lab can be deployed at no cost, either fully on-premises or partially in the cloud via a trial Digital Ocean account.

This lab serves as a practical learning environment for security professionals, students, and researchers interested in cybersecurity operations, providing hands-on experience with security monitoring, incident response, and automation workflows.

# Key Components

This lab incorporates several free and open-source tools to replicate a real-world SOC:

Wazuh – A comprehensive SIEM and XDR solution used for event collection, log analysis, and threat detection.

Shuffle – A Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform that enhances operational efficiency by automating incident response workflows.

TheHive – A case management platform designed for efficient documentation, collaboration, and structured response to security incidents.

By leveraging automation and integrating these tools, this lab aims to accelerate threat detection, optimize SOC workflows, and provide a deeper understanding of security operations in an enterprise environment.
